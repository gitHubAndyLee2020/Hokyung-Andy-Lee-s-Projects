Hello, this is a note from your personal assistance, Jarvis.
@jarvis is my social media, mind you.
%%%%*%^$&#$@% doesn't make sense, right?
Well no worries, I will conquer the world before you can figure out the message.
Silent night, holy night
All is calm and all is bright
Round yon virgin, mother and child
Holy infant, so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace, ooh
Sleep, sleep in heaven, heavenly peace
Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories streams from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing, alleluia
Christ the savior is born, he's born
Christ the savior is born
Round yon virgin, mother and child
Holy infant, so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace, oh
Sleep in heavenly peace
